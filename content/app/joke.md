# Joke ideas for federation that are still actually kinda valid but funny

## Federated mutes

as2 has an Ignore type so you could theoretically federate out mutes in the same way that blocks are currently federated

### Block/Mute reminders

anytime someone muted tries to reply, you respond with an Ignore

anytime someone blocked tries to interact, you respond with a Block

what if you do this *every single time* they try to reply/interact
