to what extent can it be said that the primary value of mastodon is in its api

mastodon isn't really all that special in the fediverse or as a software, because you have so many options and differing implementations of the activitypub protocol. but the second you try to have a mobile app, you immediately recognize the value of the mastodon api. it's a pseudo-standard at this point because it mostly just works, and pleroma/pixelfed/gotosocial copied it for compatibility with existing clients. it's a shame it isn't a real standard...

or, rather, what would a real standardized microblogging api look like? the nearest thing is probably micropub/microsub which doesn't quite do as much
