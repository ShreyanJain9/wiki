i am reminded of an essay i read once called "avoid news" which might sound extreme to some people but it actually has a simple premise: most of what you encounter in media suffers from context collapse and/or is not actionable. therefore it can never truly be relevant. what is far more valuable is filtering through the news for anything actionable worth educating people about, and presenting it in a more relevant and digestible way. not everyone should have to do this.

i'd really go further and say that these days, if you don't have a material call to action, you have nothing. what do you expect to accomplish by sharing what you're sharing? "awareness" on its own is not enough; it can even be an actively bad thing if you end up paralyzed by inaction and despairing over it. far better to actively educate people that need educating, instead of simply "raising awareness".

like, ok, i'm aware. now what?
