i fucking hate the "shorts" format. vine was okay purely because it was limited to 6 or 7 seconds -- if you're going to take away the video controls, prevent me from seeking, maybe autoloop? then i am NOT sitting there for a whole minute while you fail to get to the point. i'm not doing more than 10 seconds, maybe 15 seconds at the most. anything over that should let me seek through the video!!!! videos should always be seekable but if you're not going to make them seekable then at least limit them to one coherent logical "moment"
