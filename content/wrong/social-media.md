lack of clarity of purpose in communication

you are partly Publishing a Post to your Profile... but you are also partly Discussing a Topic in the replies/"comments" (where there isn't a real "topic" actually)

this is anecdotal but i found that with the rise of twitter, people started blogging less and going to forums less... twitter kind of filled both roles, but worse.
