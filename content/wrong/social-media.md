lack of clarity of purpose in communication <https://mastodon.social/@trwnh/110043721490119630>

you are partly Publishing a Post to your Profile... but you are also partly Discussing a Topic in the replies/"comments" (where there isn't a real "topic" actually) <https://mastodon.social/@trwnh/110078983668243890>

this is anecdotal but i found that with the rise of twitter, people started blogging less and going to forums less... twitter kind of filled both roles, but worse.

and it is worth pointing out that "social media" is a failed model created by capitalists to enclose the open web <https://mastodon.social/@trwnh/109999278215935738>

it's fine to entertain yourself, but entertainment and communications should be separate <https://mastodon.social/@trwnh/109999287012650419>
