## The three factors of radicalization

>For radicalization to occur, there are three necessary ingredients, according to Kruglanski’s research. The first is the universal need to live a worthwhile life — to have significance. People usually satisfy this need through socially accepted means, “like working hard, having families, other kinds of achievements,” Kruglanski said. Radicals instead tend to place significance on their gender, religion or race.
>
>The second is “the narrative,” which gives someone permission to use violence. Kruglanski said the narrative is usually that there is an enemy attacking your group, and the radical must fight to gain or maintain respect, honor or glory.
>
>The third necessary component is the community, or the network of people who validate the narrative and the violence.

## Deradicalization tactics

>Weilnboeck says one lesson successful facilitators have learned is to avoid engaging in debates about politics or religious doctrine with those they are trying to deradicalize.

>He says such debates usually fail to alter the belief system of a violent extremist, especially in the early stages of a deradicalization program, but will almost certainly foster distrust.
