> Service: Represents a service of any kind.

ok so... what are we supposed to do with this

this is such an ambiguous definition and it doesn't deserve to exist. definitions of "service" according to dictionaries:

- helping or doing work for someone
- routine maintenance
- the function of serving
- help, use, benefit
- religious ceremony or worship
- administrative division of govt/business
- articles with a particular use
- utility or facility
- material for a rope
- legal summons
- copulation
- ...and more

so is as:Service supposed to cover any/all of these? that seems extremely unlikely.
