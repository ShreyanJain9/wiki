# Linux laptop
i'm using an asus zenbook infinity (ux301la-dh71t) for this. main challenges of laptops are being limited to 1 monitor, needing to set up hotkeys, and other such stuff.

## WM/DE experiences/ratings

### Good?
- Sway (pure Wayland, no big dependencies, but need to figure out how to supplement it with DE stuff like notification area, easily-configurable panel, notifications, audio settings, and a better menu than dmenu) (i ended up going with sway as my main environment, paired with waybar / mako / pavucontrol / rofi, and also screenshots with grim+slurp)
- XFCE + xfwm (no-nonsense traditionalism but bad tiling, so you need to use a different workflow based around a dockbar/panel instead of tiling and workspaces.)
- XFCE + i3-gaps (a good compromise between DE and WM, at least for X11)
- Deepin (pretty but idk if it's functional yet -- play around more with it)

### Interesting
- Qtile (need to learn how to use it bc it seems decent, similar to sway/i3 but no idea how to open menus yet, unfortunately doesn't seem to be mouse-driven at all)

### IDK
- bspwm / herbsluftwm (need config before opening?)

### Not-so-good?
- Budgie (scaling a bit weird, and idk why but i don't really like the styling of it even though it's clean and makes sense)
- awesome (haven't been able to configure it how i want to with the title bars, but otherwise *seems* solid)

### Eh...
- GNOME (too limited and boring)
- KDE (bad design)

### Not good
- Openbox/Fluxbox (too much hardcoded stuff)
- Notion (too bare/ugly)

### Broken
- way-cooler (failed to compile)
- liri-desktop (no input from mouse/keyboard)
